# Burger-Sequelize
Week 15 Assignment - Burger 2: The Sequel

Overview:

The Burger app from last week's homework sequelized with a twist of Mexican.
Customer will add a taco in the input form, it will appear in the left side of the app.  If the taco gets eaten, it will move to the right side of the app.  In that column, you will be able to delete the taco.  If the customer does not input a name, it will be shamed to be an Anonymous Eater.
